        <p>
          My name is <strong>Sriram</strong>. I live in Chennai and I am
          passionate about technology and software development.<br /><br />
          My family has always supported me a lot. Because of their support, I
          am able to take my own decisions and follow what I am truly interested
          in. Now, I am happy and ready to take responsibility and support my
          family in the future.<br /> <br />
          I completed my 12th standard last year. During my studies, I started
          learning HTML by myself using YouTube resources and practiced
          regularly. After joining an academy, I learnt more programming
          languages and gained deeper knowledge about programming and how
          websites work. I continue practicing coding and improving my web
          development skills every day.

          <h3>CUET Exam</h3>
          <h4>
            The CUET has been an enriching experience that strengthened my
            problem-solving, time management, and analytical skills. <br />
            Preparing for it taught me how to tackle complex questions and adapt
            quickly to new patterns in exams. <br />
            This achievement gave me the confidence to face academic challenges
            and skills that I now apply in coding and web development projects.

          <h3>Fresh Works STS Software Academy</h3>
          <h4>
            Scoring 75% in FSAT enabled me to join Fresh Works STS Software
            Academy, where I significantly improved my programming and
            problem-solving skills. During the academy, I learnt languages in
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, and applied them to practical
            projects. <br />
            I also gained experience in teamwork, debugging, and
            project management, which helped me understand how real-world
            software development works. This experience not only sharpened my
            technical skills but also prepared me to take on independent and
            collaborative projects confidently.
